      <br>
      <h3 class="myH3">At night, or during inclement weather, most butterflies perch on the underside of a leaf, crawl deep between blades of grass or into a crevice in rocks, or find some other shelter, and sleep</h3>
      <br>
      <li><h1 class="secondH1">How many kinds of butterflies are there?</h1></li>
      <br>
      <h3 class="myH3">There are approximately 20,000 species of butterflies in the world. About 725 species have occurred in North American north of Mexico, with about 575 of these occurring regularly in the lower 48 states of the United States, and with about 275 species occurring regularly in Canada. Roughly 2000 species are found in Mexico</h3>
      <br>
      <li><h1 class="secondH1">How long does a butterfly live?</h1></li>
      <br>
      <h3 class="myH3">An adult butterfly probably has an average life-span of approximately one month. In the wild, most butterflies lives are shorter than this because of the dangers provided by predators, disease, and large objects, such as automobiles. The smallest butterflies may live only a week or so, while a few butterflies, such as Monarchs, Mourning Cloaks and tropical heliconians, can live up to nine months</h3>
      <br>
      <li><h1 class="secondH1">Random infomation about butterflies</h1></li>
      <br>
      <h3 class="myH3">Butterfly wings are transparent. Before you feel the need to schedule an eye exam, let us explain. The wings of a butterfly are covered in a multitude of miniature scales thousands of them. And those colors you see when a butterfly flits across your yard are the reflection of various colors through the scales. The wings themselves are made up of a protein called chitin, which is the same protein that forms an insects exoskeleton. And much like an exoskeleton, chitin is transparent. You have learned something new already!
        <br><br>
        There are almost 20,000 butterfly species. If you would ever considered memorizing all the various species of butterflies, it may take longer than you were anticipating. An easier starting point would be those species regularly occurring in the lower 48 states of the US. Still, that number is right around 575, so weare recommending note cards or, perhaps, focusing on the butterflies you find in and around your yard this spring and summer</h3>
